This MATLAB code allows to apply the SIFT algorithm on 3D volumes, to compute a matrix of distances between volumes thanks to the SIFT descriptors and to perform supervised classification with respect to different labels given by the dataset in this folder. 

In order to use the code, the following library is needed (it works well on MATLAB R2018a, it presents errors on MATLAB R2021a): SIFT3D 1.4.5 https://github.com/bbrister/SIFT3D/releases/tag/1.4.5
